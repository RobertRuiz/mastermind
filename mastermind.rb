  # If that color was correct *and* in the right
  # position, the value will be :exact_match. If
  # the color is correct but the position is wrong
  # the value will be :inexact_match. If the color
  # is totally wrong, the value will be :miss

  # Example:
  #
  # ruby mastermind.rb
  #
  # The Game's secret is ["Pink", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"]
  # And when guessing ["Red", "Green", "Green", "Blue"]
  # the result is [:miss, :exact_match, :miss, :inexact_match]
